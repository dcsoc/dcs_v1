                        Namaste Sweeties, <br><br>
                        Well summers are around the corner and most of you will likely go home with उम्मीदें ki 
                        Ye seekhna hai, wo seekhna hai, wagera wagera... and sure most of you will go home, will learn for few days.... and that's it.<br> Like Seriously<br>
                        
                        Jab tum log wapas aaoge, you will see ki चुनिंदा kuch hee log honge jinhone inn 2 mahine ke time kuch kiya hoga, like as in kuch worth while kiya hoga.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>How do we know this?!</b>
                        <br><br>
                        We are in 2nd year now moving to 3rd year toh ye hamari technically teesri vacation hai
                        
                        And believe me(writer/composer of this simple ass website)
                        <br>
                        Jyada tar log jaise jaate hai waise hee aa jaate hai. ( including us, ofc).<br>
                        i.e. technical skill <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before vaction == after vaction
                        <br>
                        <b>So,</b><br>
                        
                        So there are 'n' number of reasons, to
                        why this happens... <br>
                        we have our 'n' number of theories,
                        and the main thing/point was, <br><br>
                        which was/is a guess, that there is no community or a group,solely dedicated to learn the inns and outs of web development.
                        at least in our college, and many more stuff but i delete it, cause no one has time,<br><br>

                        basic thing is, one learns better, more efficiently in a community, <br>jaha aur bhi log same cheez par kaam kar rahe hote hai<br>

                        hence we thought of making our own dev community, hence
                        
                        dcs.

                    <h2>What you should want (ideally)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your "why DCS" is/should be simple<br>
                        so, your why ka answer will be, <br><br>
                        you will get a community with which you can learn, simple as that,<br>
                        Toh <br>
                        What we are intending to provide is simple...<br>
                        A community where you/we can and will learn together.<br>
