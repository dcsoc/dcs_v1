                        Ye seekhna hai, wo seekhna hai, wagera wagera... and sure most of you will go home, will learn for few days.... and that's it.<br> Like Seriously<br>
                        
                        Jab tum log wapas aaoge, you will see ki चुनिंदा kuch hee log honge jinhone inn 2 mahine ke time kuch kiya hoga, like as in kuch worth while kiya hoga.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>How do we know this?!</b>
                        <br><br>
                        We are in 2nd year now moving to 3rd year toh ye hamari technically teesri vacation hai
                        
                        And believe me(writer/composer of this simple ass website)
                        <br>
                        Jyada tar log jaise jaate hai waise hee aa jaate hai. ( including us, ofc).<br>
                        i.e. technical skill <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before vaction == after vaction
                        <br>
                        <b>So,</b><br>
                        
                        So there are 'n' number of reasons, to
                        why this happens... <br>
                        we have our 'n' number of theories,
                        and the main thing/point was, <br><br>
                        which was/is a guess, that there is no community or a group,solely dedicated to learn the inns and outs of web development.
                        at least in out college, hence<br><br>

                    <h2>What do we want out of this</h2>
                    <p>
                        You have been in college for past one or two years and we don't have a developer community in our college except for OSDC (Jo ki bahut hi achhe h)
                        What this is, What DCS is? Is our attempt to make a dev community which is beginner friendly and .......
                    </p>
                    <h2>What you should want (ideally)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your "why DCS" is simple 
                        <br>
                        Tumne sapne bahut sajaein honge, khwab bhi bahut dekhe honge ki yeh skill sikh lenge vo skill sikh lenge aur din kaffi hai toh kar hi lenge,
                        yaad karna yahi same khwab tumne college aane se pehle bhi soche the, aur yeh hi JEE se pehle bhi. This is a common trait in students of this college
                        We dream big, we do a little and we expect a lot.  
                        <br>
                        Toh <br><br>
                        What we are intending to provide is simple
                        A community where you/we can and will learn together...<br>
                        Abhi ke liye itna hi socha h... <br>
                        Peace ✌️
